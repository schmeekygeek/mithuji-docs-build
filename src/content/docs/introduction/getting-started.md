## Considerations
- The base URL of the API is `https://13.48.58.241.nip.io/test/api/v1` for the test server and `https://13.48.58.241.nip.io/prod/api/v1` for the production server.
- User is a unanimous term for both Customer and Seller, if an endpoint is Customer or Seller specific, the documentation will specify so.
- Available platforms are web and mobile.
